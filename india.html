  <p>The Taj Mahal is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river
    Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah 
    Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of
    Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex, which includes a
    mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a
    crenellated wall.

  <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the
     main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the
     Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally
     red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed
     the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and 
     combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.
